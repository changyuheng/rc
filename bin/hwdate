# Note that ntpdate is *not* really intended to be used by hosts with
# good network connectivity.  The "ntp" package, which provides a
# persistent daemon that does a better job of keeping system time than
# even a cron'ed invocation of ntpdate, is a better choice for systems
# with good network connectivity.  If all you want is to set the clock
# to a reasonable value once in a while, a more light-weight package
# like "rdate" can also do the job.
# yjchen:
# There are not rdate server in tw, so
